						SmartSearch is an app for people who are going to buy a smartphone
						but they don't have knowledge about them and about market.
					%p 
						In three easy steps app asks user for main questions about usage and then
						checks all of smartphones to choose the right one.
					%p
						The most difficult part there was to make the smartphones database with current price
						and proper data. Unfortunately this idea collapsed, when I realized that comparing smartphones by numbers is not enough.
